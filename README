This repository (created 02/18/2021) serves to hold the work that I have done since ~March 2020 with the detection of neutrons produced in the passive nuclear targets in the MINERvA experiment.

Master branch will be reserved for code that will be needed to reproduce results at key points (e.g. collaboration meetings)
Develop branch will be for all work as it progresses

Stay tuned for more information.
